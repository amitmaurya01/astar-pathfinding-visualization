# astar-pathfinding-visualization
This project visualizes the A* (Astar) pathfinding algorithm on a grid with obstacles, showing how it efficiently finds the shortest path from start to goal. Using Python's numpy and matplotlib, it generates a random map, displays the search process in real-time, and highlights the optimal path. Ideal for learning pathfinding techniques.
