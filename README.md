## A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project visualizes the A* (Astar) pathfinding algorithm on a grid-based map with obstacles. It demonstrates how the algorithm finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node. The project uses Python's `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries to generate a random map, display the search process in real-time, and highlight the optimal path.

### Features
- Randomly generates a map with obstacles.
- Visualizes the A* search algorithm.
- Displays the shortest path from start to goal.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/astar-pathfinding-visualization.git
   cd astar-pathfinding-visualization
2. **Install the required packages:**
   Make sure you have pip installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Visualization :**
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the visualization script:

   ```bash
   python astar_algorithm_visualization.py

### Uses
- The map is randomly generated each time, with a start and goal point placed in free spaces.
- The algorithm runs and displays the search process in real-time, with the path highlighted once found.
